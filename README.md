# ProceduralTerrain_Unity
Procedural Terrain Generation Tests (WIP)

Inspired by this awesome article: https://gamedevacademy.org/complete-guide-to-procedural-level-generation-in-unity-part-1/

This is the whole unity project just clone the repo and open the folder with unity.

For generating a Terrain the TerrainGenerator Script needs to have a Terrain object assigned and will edit it on the start method.

Editor Options and Windows maybe to come in the future
